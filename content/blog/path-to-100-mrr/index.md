I haven't written anything in a while because I've spent the last few months building. In my previous post I talked about _some_ indicators of interest from running Google ads to fake landing page. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to validate my idea. I had beta sign ups, but I had no indication of engagement for my fake product because not one of my sign ups replied to me when I reached out.

Obviously that's not a great sign but I also get that people are busy and very transactional. I decided to build out an MVP product as the next step and see how many people actually create an account and progress through the onboarding. If I can get that far then I can figure out the other stuff.

I also want to set myself a hard target. I had this aspirational goal of making 10k MRR but it's too far away right now. I want to set something a little more tangible so my first goalpost is $100 MRR by April 2020. I think that's achievable.
