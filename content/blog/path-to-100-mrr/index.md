I haven't written anything in a while because I've spent the last few months building. In my previous post I talked about _some_ indicators of interest from running Google ads to fake landing page. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to validate my idea. I got beta sign ups, but I had no idea of engagement for my fake product, and not one of my sign ups replied to me when I reached out.

Obviously that's not a great sign but I also get that people are busy and very transactional. So I built out an MVP product as the next step to see how many people actually create an account and progress through the onboarding. If I can get that far then I can figure out the other stuff.

I also want to set myself a hard target. I had this aspirational target of making 10k MRR but it's too far away right now. I want to set something a little more tangible so my first goal is $100 MRR by April 2020. I think that's achievable.

At its current state I don't think anyone will pay for this app until I can get the following finished:

* Single sign on
* Notifications
* _Some_ way of communicating which features are planned/in progress/complete

In parallel with feature work I'll do cold outreach for beta sign ups and google ads to test marketability.

I'm also going to start sharing monthly numbers to shame me into doing real marketing work and not just building in a vacuum

## Current State
* $0 MRR
* 1 Sign up
* 0 active users
