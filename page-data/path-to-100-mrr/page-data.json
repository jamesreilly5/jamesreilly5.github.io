In my previous post I talked about <em>some</em> indicators of interest from running Google ads to fake landing page. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough to validate my idea. I had beta sign ups, but I had no indication of engagement for my fake product because not one of my sign ups replied to me when I reached out.</p>\n<p>Obviously that’s not a great sign but I also get that people are busy and very transactional. I decided to build out an MVP product as the next step and see how many people actually create an account and progress through the onboarding. If I can get that far then I can figure out the other stuff.</p>\n<p>I also want to set myself a hard target. I had this aspirational goal of making 10k MRR but it’s too far away right now. I want to set something a little more tangible so my first goalpost is $100 MRR by April 2020. I think that’s achievable.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Path to $100 MRR","date":"December 18, 2021","description":"In my previous post I talked about _some_ indicators of interest from running Google ads to fake landing page.
