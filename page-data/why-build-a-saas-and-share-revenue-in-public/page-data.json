Every time I had a new idea I had the same fear that someone would steal it, so I decided to build in a vacuum until release. Looking back, no one was going to steal my idea because they were all flawed.</p>\n<p>This may well be my last side project, and if I’m going to build something flawed again I’d rather find out sooner and change direction.</p>\n<h2>Focus on the process not the outcome</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes I made with my other projects was having this vision of an end goal and using that as fuel to keep me going. I’d say to myself “the sooner I focus and build this, the quicker I can make money”, but I missed checking in on the milestones to see if it was <em>ever</em> going to make money.</p>\n<p>This blog is about the <strong>process</strong> of building a SaaS rather than details specific to my product. I’ll talk about things like competitor research, landing pages, positioning, validation, user interviews, metrics, distribution, and probably a lots of other stuff.</p>\n<h2>Why build in public</h2>\n<p>Reading Twitter recently it seems like I’m late to the party with the build-in-public movement, but I was inspired to do this from reading <a href=\"https://www.navalmanack.com/\">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more desire I have for something to work out a certain way, the less likely I am to see the truth. Especially in business, if something isn’t going well, I try to acknowledge it publicly and I try to acknowledge it publicly in front of my co-founders and friends and co-workers. Then, I’m not hiding it from anybody\nelse. If I’m not hiding it from anybody, I’m not going to delude myself from what’s actually going on - <em>Naval</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here’s a few of the reasons I’m documenting my ideas:</p>\n<h4>1. Clearer thinking</h4>\n<p>Not only does becoming a better writer help become a better thinker, but documenting my thoughts keeps me honest about my progress. With previous projects when I internalised my thoughts it was easy to sidestep problems with other more manageable ideas when there was any resistance. Writing for an audience forces me to address questions I know others will ask.</p>\n<h4>2. Shared experiences</h4>\n<p>I’m sure there’s a lot of people in the same boat right now. I hope some of the things I write about are useful to others but equally I hope there are people a few steps ahead of me pointing out ideas that won’t work.</p>\n<h4>3. Consistency</h4>\n<p>Here’s another idea from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval\">Naval</a> but I’m sure it’s taken from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials-ebook/dp/B002BD2UUC\">Influence: The psychology of persuasion</a>. People want to be consistent with what they say so the more people I tell about my ideas, the more chance I’ll be to follow through with them.</p>\n<h4>4. Connecting with like-minded makers</h4>\n<p>Being a maker is tough. When things are going well you’re energised and happy to keep going. When things are going badly it’s a lonely void of dispair.</p>\n<p>I honestly wish I had more people to talk to at the same stage as me to share war stories. If any of this resonates with you then feel free to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cosmic_badger\">reach out on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<h4>5. Social Proof</h4>\n<p>If I see someone tweet they reached $100 MRR I’m already intrigued. I’ll click their profile and see what they’re selling. If I someone making over $1,000 MRR and documenting their experiences I’ll follow them straight away. Knowing people are paying even a small amount for your SaaS tells people your service is valuable. Knowing people are paying a lot for your SaaS tells people your <em>ideas</em> are valuable.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why build a SaaS and share revenue in public?","date":"April 20, 2021","description":"Why building a SaaS in public and sharing revenue numbers is important"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lessons-from-5-failed-side-hustles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lessons from 5 failed side hustles"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"85df2add-03ce-5cc7-b53c-6bd5658c2859","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"9e657bbb-f4b3-5753-9e23-6ccc21dcc60a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
