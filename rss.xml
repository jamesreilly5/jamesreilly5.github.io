Every time I had a new idea I had the same fear that someone would steal it, so I decided to build in a vacuum until release. Looking back, no one was going to steal my idea because they were all flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may well be my last side project, and if I’m going to build something flawed again I’d rather find out sooner and change direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Focus on the process not the outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest mistakes I made with my other projects was having this vision of an end goal and using that as fuel to keep me going. I’d say to myself “the sooner I focus and build this, the quicker I can make money”, but I missed checking in on the milestones to see if it was &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; going to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is about the &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; of building a SaaS rather than details specific to my product. I’ll talk about things like competitor research, landing pages, positioning, validation, user interviews, metrics, distribution, and probably a lots of other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why build in public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading Twitter recently it seems like I’m late to the party with the build-in-public movement, but I was inspired to do this from reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.navalmanack.com/&quot;&gt;The Almanack of Naval Ravikant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few of the reasons I’m documenting my ideas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Clearer thinking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does becoming a better writer help become a better thinker, but documenting my thoughts keeps me honest about my progress. With previous projects when I internalised my thoughts it was easy to sidestep problems with other more manageable thoughts when there was any resistance. Writing for an audience forces me to address questions I know others will ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more desire I have for something to work out a certain way, the less likely I am to see the truth. Especially in business, if something isn’t going well, I try to acknowledge it publicly and I try to acknowledge it publicly in front of my co-founders and friends and co-workers. Then, I’m not hiding it from anybody
else. If I’m not hiding it from anybody, I’m not going to delude myself from what’s actually going on - &lt;em&gt;Naval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Shared experiences&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s a lot of people in the same boat right now. I hope some of the things I write about are useful to others but equally I hope there are people a few steps ahead of me pointing out ideas that won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Consistency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/naval&quot;&gt;Naval&lt;/a&gt; but I’m sure it’s taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com.au/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials-ebook/dp/B002BD2UUC&quot;&gt;Influence: The psychology of persuasion&lt;/a&gt;. People want to be consistent with what they say so the more people I tell about my ideas, the more chance I’ll be to follow through with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Connecting with like-minded makers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a maker is tough. When things are going well you’re energised and happy to keep going. When things are going badly it’s a lonely void of dispair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly wish I had more people to talk to at the same stage as me to share war stories. If any of this resonates with you then feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cosmic_badger&quot;&gt;reach out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Social Proof&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I see someone tweet they reached $100 MRR I’m already intrigued. I’ll click their profile and see what they’re selling. If I someone making over $1,000 MRR and documenting their experiences I’ll follow them straight away. Knowing people are paying even a small amount for your SaaS tells people your service is valuable. Knowing people are paying a lot for your SaaS tells people your &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; are valuable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
